It quickly reaches an accuracy of 96%, but doesn't improve much beyond this. To improve the accuracy further, we need to make the model more powerful. As you can probably guess, this can be achieved by increasing the size of the hidden layer, or adding more hidden layers. I encourage you to try out both these approaches and see which one works better."

    "## Summary and Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the topics covered in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We created a neural network with one hidden layer to improve upon the logistic regression model from the previous tutorial. We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We defined some utilities like `get_default_device`, `to_device` and `DeviceDataLoader` to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We were able to use the exact same training loop: the `fit` function we had define earlier to train out model and evaluate it using the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try changing the size of the hidden layer, or add more hidden layers and see if you can achieve a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try changing the batch size and learning rate to see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the training times on a CPU vs. GPU. Do you see a significant difference. How does it vary with the size of the dataset and the size of the model (no. of weights and parameters)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some references for further reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [A visual proof that neural networks can compute any function](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html), also known as the Universal Approximation Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [But what *is* a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - A visual and intuitive introduction to what neural networks are and what the intermediate layers represent\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Stanford CS229 Lecture notes on Backpropagation](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes-backprop.pdf) - for a more mathematical treatment of how gradients are calculated and weights are updated for neural networks with multiple layers."
